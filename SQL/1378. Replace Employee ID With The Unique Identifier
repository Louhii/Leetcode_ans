# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT unique_id, name FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI ON Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id


SELECT chooses the two columns to return (id and name) from employees table.

The left Join from UNI checks to make sure all rows are found in both, and if not it is returned as a null value
